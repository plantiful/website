There are two branches, one is [main](https://github.com/plantiful/website/tree/main) which is displayed on [plantiful.cz](https://plantiful.cz) and the other is [dev](https://github.com/plantiful/website/tree/dev) which is used for development and is displayed on [plantiful.github.io/website](https://plantiful.github.io/website/)

So for development, you should use the dev branch:
